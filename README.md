Made by Marcelo Kallmann, 2010

This toolkit reflects the 2010 implementation for the SCA 2010 paper
  "Shortest Paths with Arbitrary Clearance from Navigation Meshes".

The updated LCT definition, correct handling of dynamic operations,
  and robustness algorithms that are described in the TOG 2014 paper
  "Dynamic and Robust Local Clearance Triangulations" are not integrated
  in this toolkit. (Sadly)
